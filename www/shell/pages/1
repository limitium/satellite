'body'=>"I have been sitting on reporting this best blog for a little while now (work, school, and such has kept me distracted) but now it is time to let it out of the box.

About a week and a half ago I was browsing around the tag surfer when I (happily) stumbled across Elle Effect. Lauren, the author, is an eighteen year old artist who not only gives us a glimpse into her artistic works but also into the thoughts and situations of her daily life.

What I quickly discoved is that this young girl possesses a mind able to delve into the deeper end of life through both the visual arts as well as the written word.

All this is why I consider Elle Effect a best blog.");
