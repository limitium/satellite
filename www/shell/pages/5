Tiger Feet
Given that Tiger Feet really hates spiders, maybe it’s not so nice to begin this post about her blog with a picture of one.

Still, she’s also quite funny and this particular spider, which resides on her wonderful personal blog, isn’t really all that scary.

If someone can make you laugh about the rotten weather in Manchester, and get you to cheer her on as she loses weight, then she’s created a very fine personal blog.
