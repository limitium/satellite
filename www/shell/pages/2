A Slice of Life
Witty, down-to-earth, and great with a good cup of coffee.  That is what A Slice of Life is. 

I stumbled across this blog after Susan, the author, left a very nice comment on my own personal blog.  Little did I suspect that clicking on her name would lead me to several enjoyable musings.

So take a minute, pour yourself a cup of coffee and relax with a bit of A Slice of Life.
