"body"=>"According to the Blog Stats sidebar widget, Tiny Cat Pants — a very smart, funny, idiosyncratic blog — has tallied more than 23,000 hits since coming to WordPress March 03, 2007. Written semi-anonymously, by someone who calls herself Aunt B., Tiny Cat Pants takes on all comers, doles out sharp criticism for idiot politicians, picks fights with other bloggers, periodically redefines feminism to suit its author’s mood, and in general, has a heck of a good time not taking itself very seriously.

Gosh, it’s funny. If you visit, start with the FAQ page to acclimate yourself to its quirky sense of humor.

It can be moving, too. Here’s an example that impressed us:

“I came home from work today to find [my brother] the Butcher sprawled out on the floor in front of the TV. “How was your day?” he asked and I said, “I hate my life.” He asked, “Why?” And I said, “No good reason. Nothing bad happened. Everything is fine. I’m just miserable.” And he said, “I know just what you mean.”

“And you know, that’s the thing about brothers, when your brother says “I know just what you mean,’ you know it’s the truth. You know he’s looking right at you and really seeing you as a person he has loved his whole life and who he knows as well as he knows himself. And it’s like you can put it down for a while, whatever it is that you’re carrying around with you, you can just leave it right there at the front door, recognized, acknowledged, and of no consequence, at least for a while.”

That’s just a tidbit from a blogger who will only consider running for President if it doesn’t interfere with her real ambition to be Queen of the Planet.");
