Have you ever wondered what went on inside the mind of a young woman? Well, Abby over at the Mennogirl blog has decided to give us a glimpse into just that.

Abby is a current Chicago resident who has dedicated her blog to the purpose of self expression. As she says:

    I donâ€™t tend to write about much beyond the random thoughts that enter my head, so if you are looking for consistently amazing writing, biting social commentary, deep personal revelations you might want to look elsewhere. But if you are up for some randomness with a bit of dorkiness and a twist of wit, welcome.

Indeed, the writings of mennogirl are rather random but still quite engaging and personable. So for a bit of dorky randomness (in a good way) check out Mennogirl.
